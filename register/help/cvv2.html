?>

A CID is a special security code feature on your Visa, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover credit card.

<h4>How does my CID protect me?</h4>
CIDs are not raised, so they are not scanned into standard credit card readers. In theory, these numbers are only visible to you. When you give your CID to a merchant, you assist the merchant in verifying that the order is being placed by you, the card holder.

<h4>How do I find my Card Security Code?</h4>
<b>Visa Credit Card Users</b><br>
Flip your card over and look at the signature box. You should see a 16-digit credit card number followed by a special 3-digit code. This 3-digit code is your Card Security Code.

<p><b>MasterCard Credit Card Users</b><br>
Flip your card over and look at the signature box. You should see a 16-digit credit card number followed by a special 3-digit code. This 3-digit code is your Card Security Code.
