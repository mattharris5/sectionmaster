	  <h1>SectionMaster Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Any time you visit a Web site, you may be providing information about
yourself to the site's owner or operator. We at SectionMaster, like you, value
privacy, so we want you to learn what you need to know to protect your personal
privacy. When you visit or supply information to any Web site, it's a good idea
for you to first understand the site's privacy policies. If the site owner
doesn't tell you, don't hesitate to ask. </p>

<p><b>The bottom line</b> at our Web site
(also referred to generally as the &quot;SectionMaster.org site&quot;) is that
we use information that we get from your visit to enable you to participate in
and take advantage of the various programs and features presented on the
SectionMaster.org site and to make the SectionMaster.org site useful and
interesting to you. We do not use the information that we collect from the
SectionMaster.org site for any other purpose, nor do we share it with any
affiliate or third party, except those specifically under contract with
SectionMaster to collect information for primary uses only.</p>

	  <h2>A special note about children</h2>
	  <p>The SectionMaster.org site is not intended for children under the age 
		of 13, and SectionMaster does not knowingly collect personal information 
		from those children, per the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act 
		(COPPA).&nbsp; Collection of any information about children under the 
		age of 13 is only permitted to be sent by the child's parent or legal 
		guardian; such a child may not submit any information on his or her own 
		behalf without assistance.&nbsp; A child's age is verified with a consent 
		statement upon entering the child's date of birth on the initial entry 
		page(s) of the SectionMaster.org site.</p>

	  <h2>Applicability of this privacy policy</h2>
<p>This privacy policy applies only to the information that we collect on the
SectionMaster.org site and not to any information collected through other
methods or sources, including sites owned or operated organizations contracted
with SectionMaster. When visiting other Web sites that are not owned or
operated by SectionMaster, please review the privacy policy for those sites.</p>

	  <h2>Notice</h2>

<h4>What personal information we collect and how we use it</h4>

<p>While you can browse our site without providing personal information, you
will need to input certain personal information as indicated on specific pages
of our site in order to take advantage of certain features, such as registering
for events or purchasing merchandise.  Use of the SectionMaster.org site is voluntary,
and your use constitutes your consent for the information provided to be stored
and used by SectionMaster in order for SectionMaster to fulfill its contracted
agreements to provide event registration and other similar services.</p>

<p>Only authorized organization administrators are permitted to
view information stored in the organization's database.  The list of
administrators is determined at the time the organization signs the Usage
Agreement.  Administrative access can be requested or revoked by the original
signer of the agreement or his supervisor.  SectionMaster reserves the right to
deny access to any administrator in the event suspicious activity is observed
that may compromise the security and integrity of personal information stored
on the SectionMaster.org site.</p>

<h4>Browsing and the use of cookies and logs</h4>

<p>When you visit the SectionMaster.org site we use "cookies"
to store your user session while you are logged on to our website.  A cookie is
a small amount of data that is transferred to your browser by a web server and
can only be read by the server that gave it to you.  It cannot be executed as
code or deliver viruses.</p>

<p>Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies.  You can
set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance
to decide whether to accept it.  Cookies are required to use the
SectionMaster.org site.</p>

<p>While the SectionMaster.org Web servers automatically log
the IP/Internet address of your computer, SectionMaster does not use this
information other than to protect ourselves and our members against fraud and
illegal activity.  SectionMaster does not use cookies to "remember" the user
logon credentials you use to sign on to the site.  The cookies we use are
"session only" cookies and are removed when your visit to our site ends.</p>

<p>We also use standard Web server log files to help us count visitors and
evaluate our site's technical capacity. This information tells us how many
people visit the SectionMaster.org site, and helps us decide how to arrange
pages in the most user-friendly way. It also helps us keep the site
browser-friendly and more useful to our visitors. We record information on site
traffic, but not on individual visitors to our site, so no personal information
about you will be kept or used.</p>

<h4>Email, mailing lists, and other services</h4>

<p>When you send us an email, we use your email address to thank you for your
comment and/or reply to your question. We store your communication and our
reply in case we correspond further. Beyond our initial reply, we will not use
your email address to send you any unsolicited message or information, nor will
we share it with, or sell it to, anyone else for such use, other than as
specified in this policy. </p>

<p>When you request information or services, we use your email address and any
other information you give us to provide you with the information or services
you've requested until you ask us to stop (by using "unsubscribe" instructions
provided on each email and/or the Web site where you signed up and/or as we
otherwise provide), or until the information or service is no longer available.
We will not use your email address or other information to provide you with any
unsolicited message or information (unless the message or information is part
of the service you are requesting). </p>

<h4>Links to other sites</h4>

<p>We work closely with our contracted partners, many of which have links
within the SectionMaster.org site. Please remember that when you use a link to
go from the SectionMaster.org site to another Web site, this Privacy Policy no
longer applies. Your browsing and interaction on any third party's Web site,
including any site that has a link on the SectionMaster.org site, is subject to
the rules and policies of that site. We encourage you to read the rules and
policies of the sites you visit to better understand their procedures for
collecting, using, and disclosing personal information. </p>

<h4>Our policy regarding selling or renting of personal information</h4>

<p>Our policy is simple: we do not sell or rent your personal information to
any third parties under any circumstances, except in the event of a bankruptcy
or reorganization, or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets, as
further provided below.  Data collected is provided only to authorized
representatives of the organizations with which SectionMaster has contracted to
provide event registration and other services.  Your information is not
compiled into one large master national database accessible by overseers, but
rather, is separated by individual organizations contracted with SectionMaster.</p>

<h4>Business transfers</h4>

<p>If a third party acquires all or substantially all of our assets, your
personal information, aggregated information, and any other information that we
have collected on the SectionMaster.org site will not be transferred to such third
party as part of our business assets.  Your information is private, and is not
considered an asset of SectionMaster. </p>

<h4>Disclosure of personal information for legal
purposes and protection of SectionMaster and others</h4>

<p>We reserve the right to share your personal information with third parties
if required to do so by law, or if we believe such action is necessary in order
to: (a) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with legal process
served upon us; (b) protect or defend our legal rights or property, the
SectionMaster.org site, or our users; or (c) investigate, prevent, or take
action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving
potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or violations of the
terms and conditions for using the SectionMaster.org site. </p>

	  <h2>Choice</h2>

<h4>How you can decide what communication you'll receive from us</h4>

<p>You will never be automatically subscribed to any mailing lists by using the
SectionMaster.org site unless explicitly indicated. If you choose to receive
them, we may periodically send you email messages describing updates, new
features, or promotional offers related to this Web site. You can choose to
stop receiving this email at any time. Simply follow the instructions included
in your email, or send a reply stating your request.</p>

<p>If you do not explicitly choose to receive informational emails, the only
email messages you will receive from SectionMaster will be a response to an
email inquiry that you send us.</p>

<p>You may, as part of having your data collected on behalf of an organization
contracted by SectionMaster, receive e-mails originating from the
SectionMaster.org site but sent by authorized representatives of the
contracting organization.  These messages will only relate to your relationship
with that organization and will not solicit services for or with SectionMaster
or any of its entities unrelated to services provided by the SectionMaster.org
site.</p>

	  <h2>Access and data retention</h2>

<h4>How to update, correct, or delete your personal information</h4>

<p>You can access and modify certain personal information stored on the
SectionMaster.org site, such as your name, phone number, email address, and
mailing address, by contacting us via email or mail at the address set forth
below in the &quot;How to contact SectionMaster regarding your concerns and
questions&quot; section. </p>

<p>To modify or delete personal information related to an email program, simply
follow the instructions included in your email, or send a reply stating your
request, and we will make the requested changes. </p>

<p>We retain information provided to us only until the organization contracting
with SectionMaster no longer uses services provided by the SectionMaster.org
site. We may keep some personal information you have requested to remove for
the following purposes:</p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li>Troubleshoot problems </li>
 <li>Assist with investigations </li>
 <li>Enforce our site rules </li>
 <li>Comply with legal requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will
always be completely removed from our databases in response to a request from you
or the termination of contract with an organization using services provided by
SectionMaster.</p>

	  <h2>Security</h2>

<h4>How we protect the security of your personal information</h4>

<p>The security of your personal information is very important to us, and we
are committed to protecting the information we collect. The SectionMaster.org
site uses firewalls and Secure Socket Layer ("SSL") to transport all personal data we collect
from you. We also employ many different security techniques to protect personal
data against loss, misuse, alteration, and unauthorized access. But we cannot
guarantee perfect security of your personal information. </p>

<p>When you send confidential personal information to us on our
website, such as credit card information, member name, or user ID and passkey,
secure server software that we have licensed encrypts all information you input
before it is sent to us.  The information is scrambled en route and decoded
once it reaches our website using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) and the Secure
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS).  By default, when signed on or making a
payment, all communication with us is encrypted.</p>

	  <p>Secure communication can be verified by clicking on your web browser's security 
		seal, often appearing as a padlock. The SectionMaster.org site utilizes 
		"Shared-SSL" technology offered by its web provider, WestHost, Inc. The 
		secure certificate is issued by <a href="http://thawte.com" target="_blank">Thawte, 
		Inc</a>. SectionMaster URLs, when in secure mode, will appear as they 
		are running at https://ssl4.westserver.net/sectionmaster.org, but this 
		is normal and can be trusted to be as secure as any other secure website.</p>

<p>We also use encrypted communications to transmit information
between us and our service providers.  For example, to process credit card
payments we have a secure connection to our payment processor.</p>

<p>For software, secure communications, and service providers
we only use well-known and established companies generally recognized a leader
in their field.  For example, we use Elavon and Authorize.net for payment processing, the
most reliable payment processor in the industry.</p>

<p>We do not store or maintain highly sensitive information. 
This information includes social security and credit card numbers.  Where we
are required to collect this information to fulfill a product or service, we
immediately pass it on to the service provider.</p>

<p>To safeguard the confidentiality of personal information we
collect from unauthorized access or disclosure our servers are housed behind a
firewall in secure, restricted access facilities with 24-hour surveillance
provided by WestHost, Inc.  Only named and authorized representatives of
WestHost, Inc. can physically access our servers.  Detailed information about
our web provider's facilities can be found at <a
href="http://www.westhost.com/datacenter.html" target="_blank">http://www.westhost.com/datacenter.html</a>.</p>
